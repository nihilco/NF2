        Tate Township is one of the fourteen townships of Clermont County, Ohio which includes 46.9 square miles. The village of Bethel is located in central Tate Township. Bethel is sometimes referred to as Bethel-Tate for this reason; an example of this would be the Bethel-Tate School District.
            </p>
            <p>
            The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1<sup>st</sup>. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. 
     </p>

        There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term  beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.
