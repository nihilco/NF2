     <h4>Richard A. Stowell<small>, Chief</small></h4>
     <p>
     Born April 22, 1961 to my parents, Richard and Lou and grew up in Bethel my entire life. Joined the fire department as a Fire Cadet August 1978 while a senior in high school and also worked at Lories Market as a stock boy and working at the meat counter. Learned how to cut meat while employed at Lories. Graduated from Bethel-Tate in 1979, became a regular volunteer fireman and got a part time meat cutting job at Kroger in Montgomery after my day job at Lories. Did that for 2 years, then was hired as a fulltime meat cutter at Bethel IGA, leaving Lories and Kroger. While working at IGA, John Munafo would let me leave work to make fire runs during the day, which back in the early 1980’s, we only had 2 or 3 firemen who was around during the day. I was promoted to Lt. in 1987, left Bethel IGA after being hired as a fulltime firefighter by Tate Township in March 1991, promoted to Captain in 1996, and appointed by the Tate Township Trustees as fulltime Fire Chief Jan 1, 2001. I am the oldest active firefighter on the department, feels like just a few years ago I was the youngest. I’ve been married to my wife Debbie (Crumpton) Stowell for 34 years, have one daughter, Kristen (Wilson) and a grandson Parker, who is more than likely going to carry on the family tradition of being a firefighter. I have less than 2 years until I’m eligible for retirement. Certifications through the State of Ohio are Firefighter II, Fire Inspector, Emergency Medical Technician-Basic, and Hazmat Tech. I’ve been on the department a total of 36 1/2 years, 24 years fulltime.

     <h4>Kent Bryant<small></small></h4>
     <p>
Started in the fire service in 1984 in California.  I had joined Orange Co Fire Dept as a paid per call firefighter.  The dept put me through some mini academy training&#39;s.  My crew was a hand crew (Crew 50) which fought wild land fires.  We also helped the investigation teams on structure fires and did some clean up.  After about 3 years I moved closer to a first responding station (25) in Midway City.  We would respond to the station and would take the engine to all emergencies in the area.  We were backed up by a full time station out of Stanton, and Mutual aid with Westminster.  I attended Santa Ana College and received my Degree in Public Fire Service and attended  the 73rd basic fire academy which went on for about 3 months.  After graduation I secured a position with the Santa Ana Fire Dept as a reserve firefighter.  This dept also put me through a mini training academy.   This meant that I was the 4th person on a truck.  I had the opportunity to work from both engines and tiller style ladder trucks.  Both departments were very busy and I feel my experiences there are priceless.  Later we moved to Ohio near family where I started volunteering again.  I obtained my EMT certification, then Paramedic as well as 240 fire certification.  I worked with Miami Twp for about 9 years, Milford for 2 yrs, and Salem for 1.  In the mean time I also worked for Bethel-Tate part time for a year until I gained a full time position almost 10 years ago.  On my days off I help provide for my family as a State licensed plumbing contractor.  When I do have a break to relax,  motorcycle riding and fishing are my go to activities.
