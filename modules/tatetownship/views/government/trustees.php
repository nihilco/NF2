     <h4>James G. Burns<small>, Trustee</small></h4>
     <p>
     I, James G. Burns, am a life long resident of Tate Township.  I graduated from Bethel-Tate High school.  I married my high school sweetheart, Corinne, in 1975.  To this union two children were born.
     </p>
     <p>
     My daughter, Tiffiany, married David Riddle.  They have two children, Nathan and Makenzie.   They also live in Tate-Township.  My son, James, married Tiffany Balk and they reside in Winchester, Kentucky.
     </p>
     <p>
     I started working at the family business in October 1968.  I took over the business in 1990.  And I am there still today.
     </p>
     <p>
     I joined Bethel-Tate Fire Department in 1973.  I enjoyed many years serving Tate-Township in that capacity until the late 80â€™s.
     </p>
     <p>
     I am a member and Past Master of Bethel Lodge 61.  I am a past member of the Bethel Lions Club and served as President for two years.  I served as Assistant Scout Master for Boy Scout Troop 196.  I am a member of the Sons of American Legion, Bethel Post 406.  I sponsored the SADD chapter at Bethel-Tate High School and assisted in numerous simulations of drunk driving accidents for the chapter.  I have sponsored numerous local baseball and softball teams.  I have supplied the touchdown cannon for Bethel-Tate High School football games for ten plus years.
     </p>
     <p>
     I was elected as Tate Township Trustee in 1994 to serve a two year unexpired term.  I was then defeated and then re-elected.  I have held that position ever since.  During the years I have observed Tate Township changing.  I have done my best to keep ahead of the changes to better serve the residents of the township.  I am a strong supporter of our Fire Department, who is second to none.  I am extremely proud of our Road and Cemetery Departments.  Our Zoning Department does its best to keep up with our zoning regulations.
     </p>
     <p>
     Remember this is your Township to enjoy and protect.  I will continue to do my best to serve our community.  Thank you.
     </p>
     <p>
     Sincerely,<br />
     James G. Burns
